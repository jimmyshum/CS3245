== General Notes about this assignment ==

Place your comments or requests here for Min to read.  Discuss your
architecture or experiments in general.  A paragraph or two is usually
sufficient.

The whole homework is mainly focused on searching part.

In search.py, a main function inside is called search(â€¦). For implementing the document scoring environment and the itc-inc ranking scheme , several functions have been coded.
For the query side,'calWTFT()' is for calculating the term frequency of the query. 'normalization()' is for normalizing the result. 

For the document side, The 'idf_from_df()' is for retrieving the document frequency (df), 'tf_from_raw()' is for getting the term frequency from the input file, and the 'get_doc_itc()' is getting the document itc. The get_checking_doc_list is to generate the common term list for both query side and the document side .the 'product()' is for calculating the doc product between the query vector and the document vector. . After running all the functions, the result of itc-inc ranking list is generated and stored for comparison. 

Finally, the score for the 10 most highest documents will be put into the output file.
