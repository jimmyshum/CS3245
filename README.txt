== General Notes about this assignment ==

Place your comments or requests here for Min to read.  Discuss your
architecture or experiments in general.  A paragraph or two is usually
sufficient.

The whole homework is mainly divided into 2 main parts, indexing and searching.
In index.py,

In search.py, a main function inside is called search(…). For my logic to deal with the boolean expression, the concept of stack is implemented so that the whole expression is changed from infix to postfix in order to calculate the result easily. Then, another stack is used for evaluating the whole postfix query into the result of index lists. After that, 
get_posting(…) function is called for linking to the index.py and get the requested index list. Finally, the index list result retrieved and is written to the output.txt
 
In index.py, in order to avoid reading the whole posting file into memory, 
there are frequent file read and write. So, the indexing process is very slow.
Also, I have used a “silly” way to edit the posting file — write the whole file 
to tmp file, and rename the tmp file into the original filename every time.
For small amount of files, it works. But with large amount of documents in reuters, 
it take more than a hour to index all of them.
